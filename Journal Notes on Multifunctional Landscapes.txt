A shift to the production of amenity values appears inherent in modern rural places, including Australia
Amenity can have complex meanings, but tends to focus on "attractiveness or otherwise of the general environment" and "qualities or facilities of locale"
Amenity can have multiple dimensions, depending on scale and level (time - weekly, monthly, so on), with site dominant at short timescale
Amenity is an anthropocentric concept, a complex of interlocking factors, preferences, which complicates selection of indicators
Australia is an interesting object of study due to general loss of population in internal area, but migration to some rural areas
Actually understanding a regional amenity provision level is difficult to quantify, some material indicators must be identified
Indicators include climate, topography, surface water, amount of park/wilderness land, winter rec. opps., beach distance, remoteness, rec. employment
Uneven distribution of all of these relative to the land base in rural Australia, some places far more rich than others
Utilized indicators identified above in attempt to quantify/spatially locate high-amenity areas in southern Aus
Coefficients functioned in model as predicted in terms of direction, but many correlations were rather weak, inter-correlations a problem
Creation of 'Amenity Index' based on metrics with strongest association resulted in settlement duration, beach distance, rec. employ, irrigation strongest
Counter-intuitive results obtained, and there is a reasonable question about how possible it is to generate a single amenity index

The ideas of 'multifunctional agricultural landscapes emerged from trade debates at the WTO via the EU, arguing ag landscapes provide many services
An opposing view is that purposeful investments in ecological improvements are superior than relying on multifunctionality in agriculture
In both the US and UK public money is directed towards ag/rural areas, transferring material benefits via a variety of mechanisms
Focus group studies in the UK and US saw that farmers in both areas were concerned about sustaining future agricultural operations
UK farmers tended to emphasize diversification, but both saw expansion of equine activities as important, UK folks seemed better able to plan
Links between farm and community were important, but in UK there were closer links than in the uS between communities and farmers

It is anticipated that governance, defined as shared forms of planning (between traditional institutions and citizens), will be important to multifunct.
Planning for whole landscapes, not merely one territory or type of land, is important as an emerging paradigm, optimizing broad land use patterns
As part of sustainable development writ whole, multifunctionality is essential as part of creating sustainable livelihoods
In Portugal, even in the recent past rural areas saw agro-silviculture synthesis, inherent multifunctionality, undermined by mass production ag
Study in Portugal contrasted two communities to identify variation in social values and governance regimes, each had different ending views
Study attempted to utilize scenario planning, presenting image of landscape and letting interviewees 'design' desired future landscape
Focus groups were asked how forests could fill social needs, be economically viable, and promote ecological/biological diversity
The farmer/landholder culture in one town tended to emphasize a 'traditional multifunctionality', in the other a 'new multifunctionality' was preferred
Traditional multifunctionality is tid to traditional land use with pluriactive potential, emphasizing productivity and economic activity
New multifunctionality incorporated more explicitly ecosystem services and environmental protection, water flow regulation, and carbon sequestration
Livestock grazing serves as a major differentiation, with traditional activities integrated, while in new grazing is limited and fenced
Traditional multifunctionality tends to emphasize endogenous activities, with new multifunctionality relying more on exogenous (tourism, PES)
Different species emphasized with respect to trees, with more broad forest coverage tied to new multifunctionality
Advantage of study design is that scenario planning coupled with visual technology allowed for participatory research, designed landscapes
One major finding is that governance institutions are vital to actually realizing this future, and in this case they were lacking in both cases


4. Evans, Nick, Morris, Carol, Winter, Michael. 2002. Conceptualizing agriculture: a critique of post-productivism as the new orthodoxy. Progress in Human Geography 26:3, 313-332

Post-Productivism has been theorized as the contemporary paradigm for shifting European, particularly UK, agricultural systems away from production
Emergence appears tied to political mechanisms in EU and member countries for ensuring the persistence of agricultural subsidies
A number of disciplines have adopted the term, and its use has become widespread enough that its definition is often left unprinted in works
Context for P-P is rooted as well in declining agricultural profitability dating to the 1970s and continuing
Empirical evidence for a shift appears lacking given the loose definitions and relatively short observational timeframe for observing change
P-P tends to claim that quality focus, pluriactivity (diversification of activities), extensification, dispersion, regulation are characteristic of P-P
The dualism of P-P is concerning, and seems to indicate that ag is becoming less integrated into world markets
All of the supposed P-P characteristics have long been present in farms, with farmers using a variety of strategies to survive
The concept functions as a 'distraction from theorizing' and does not explain the why, but simply serves as a description of what
Actor Network Theory, Ecological modernization proposed as potential alternate pathways to P-P, which should be abandoned as untenable


5. Fry, Gary L.A. 2001. Multifunctional landscapes - towards transdisciplinary research. Landscape and Urban Planning 57: 159-168

Agricultural landscapes are multifunctional by nature, but single discipline research efforts don't fully recognize the complexity, interactions
Interdisciplinary work is necessary, but there are significant challenges in the academic world to making interdisciplinary work happen
Landscape is a potential unifying theme, allowing different disciplines to participate, assess multifunctionality
*More here about interdisciplinarity, good stuff, just not really multifunctionality specific


6. Hibbard, Michael & Lurie, Susan. 2013. The New Natural Resource Economy. Society & Natural Resources 26:7, 827-844

Rural populations have declined during the 20th Century, and along with them rural economic health has declined
Rural areas typically rely on primary production - agriculture and natural resources - for their economic productivity
Industrialization, Specialization, Standardization, Consolidation, and the Commodity production orientation of society are rural banes
A new paradigm is emerging, that of the New Natural Resource Economy, which seeks to diversify rural economic activity
Rural people appear to value their state of existence enough to accept lower wages and income, but poverty is now endemic
They are rebuilding around the natural resources they are typically proximate to, but not focusing on only one industry/company
Money that enters rural regions tends to have outsized effects than its simple dollar amount would seem to indicate
Payment for Ecosystem Services is a reasonable concept rooted in the hidden benefits external agents gain from natural systems
Community supported agriculture systems and other small-scale production initiatives can scale to the needs of rural areas
Stability has long been sought but has remained elusive for rural communities dependent on commodity production: resilience is better
Resilient communities under NNRE have 3 dimensions: A traded sector, import replacement, and ensuring local goods availability
A traded sector where goods can be produced for sale externally is still important, but can't be the entire focus
Import replacement involves local production of goods and services where feasible to avoid cash outflows
Ensuring availability of local goods means promoting local businesses and service providers to meet needs locally
Grant County, Umatilla County, and Vernonia are 3 examples of movements towards more resilient NNRE economies
Rural communities rely on very small businesses and natural capital, their location will most always ensure these are the case
NNRE fits well with the emerging idea of multifunctionality, utilizing landscape to provide multiple values


7. Hollander, Gail M. 2004. Agricultural trade liberalization, multifunctionality, and sugar in the south Florida landscape. Geoforum 35, 299-312


Multifunctionality has typically arisen as an argument in response to protecting ag lands from trade liberalization
In Florida, sugar cane has often been planted in the everglades as a hedge against farm losses, part of widespread and complex sugar infrastructure
Sugar cane production in the everglades has come to be opposed by much of the environmental movement in the area demanding Everglades restoration
Multifunctionality is primarly of 2 flavors - weak, being tied mainly to trade concerns, strong, a more radical restructuring of land use
Historic cane sugar production in Florida has tied small producers to company owned processing infrastructure in a close-knit system
It provided labor opportunities at a slack time, but has come under threat from suburban environmental groups unconcerned with farmer livelihood
Attempts at 'restoration' via agriculture idling are not necessarily beneficial - long managed landscape, possible negative consequences of idling
A potential multifunctional pathway with respect to sugar cane is that its growth in places serves a stabilizing function for current landscape
European claims to a unique way of agriculture not easily sustained, multifunctional concepts implicit for much of agricultural history
Weak multifunctionality arguments do not counter liberalization of trade and production responsible for undermining current multifunctionality
Strong multifunctionality sees it as resistance to globalization/liberalization, but not always are purported benefits present or apparent
A danger of multifunctionality is its typically fuzzy definition, it seems to be adapted to situations as needed, and risks incoherence


8. Holmes, John. 2002. Diversity and change in Australia's rangelands: a post-productivist transition with a difference? Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 27:1, 362-384

Wilson's critique of the P/P-P debate may transfer well from agriculture to rangeland systems, important in US West and Australia
Australian rangelands are experiencing a significant transition although they are spatially distant from major capital accumulation centers
Outback has been historically associated with pastoralism despite the low contribution of this practice to overall Australian GDP
Neoliberal and rationalist economic assumptions have deeply impacted rural Australia, less so in pastoral areas due to distance but still important
Australian fiscal subsidies equally applied to regions have led to more money directed to rural, sparsely populated provinces, to promote development
A general P-P transition seems evident from evidence, with changing state attention and legal regimes shifting activities in Outback
Increasing attention to aboriginal land rights and their expanding claims under a unique mechanism is shifting pastoral land use
Aboriginal land titles and the concordant use of land is tied to desire for access, not occupancy, in accordance with past traditions
P/P-P transition ideas seem justified in Australian Outback context, although European-specific conceptions are not always tenable
Transition drivers are Ag overcapacity, Amenity uses, and changing values in society, and multifunctionality may well be a useful concept


9. Holmes, John. 2006. Impulses towards a multifunctional transition in rural Australia: Gaps in the research agenda. Journal of Rural Studies 22, 142-160

"at its core, the multifunctinal transition involves a radical re-ordering in the three basic purposes underlying human use of rural space, namely production, consumption, and protection."
This transition is characterized by a shift from the production focus to a more diverse set of balanced production, consumption, protection interests
P-P has not entirely escaped UK, with not enough attention paid to the ideas even in other anglophone regions
But multifunctionality is a better concept as it applies to rural areas more generally, recognizes 20th century as possible aberration
Historically, multifunctionality was the rule in land use, in the 'holistic' subsistence mode, only industrialization led to monofunctionality
Ties to European and WTO rules with respect to policy and trade, and broadly connected to the push for sustainability in land use
Identifies a series of different modes of occupance which emphasize different values in different ways - consumption, production, protection
Australia's different settlement patterns and amount of space causes different patterns from UK, as there is less competition between mods
***this article provides a typology of different modes and describes the characteristics of each, created by author
Population density is strongly tied to landholder options and mode of occupance seen, so inland/coastal Aus. trajectories differ
Different typologies have been developed to characterize rural, these tend to be context-dependent, between Aus. and UK
Combines aspects of Marsden and Barr typologies, incorporating into a triple axis (pyramid) with axis of consumption, production, protection
US context likely requires further categories in such a typology given the level of public land ownership, government regulations, multiple us doctrine
In Australia, there's a context where movement between modes appears to be underway, in places, depending on de-intensification of, usually, pastoral land


10. Holmes, John. 2010. Divergent Regional Trajectories in Australia's Tropical Savannas: Indicators of a Multifunctional Rural Transition. Geographical Research 48:4, 342-358


Multifunctionality can be considered as existing between poles of production, consumption, protection, with a series of modes based on particulars
Transition can take place in a region between one more or another between these poles, can be tracked empirically over time
This work attempts to assign a score based on amenity values to regions in Northern Australia, connecting them to CSIRO metrics in pastoral areas
A transition is taking place where farms are moving towards multifunctionality, mediated by local conditions


11. Huttunen, Suvi. Wood energy production, sustainable farming livelihood and multifunctionality in Finland. Journal of Rural Studies 28, 549-558

Farmers in Europe but also Finland have faced structural changes which have caused loss in farm numbers even as farm sized have increased
Many farms are adopting auxiliary production, a major component of which is renewable energy production, particularly heat entrepreneurship
Heat entrepreneurship is primarily focused on using wood products to generae heat energy, and small businesses are set up that own/supply heat units
Some are owner-operated, many are actually cooperative projects, some entrepreneurs are involved in several projects
Biofuel/bioenergy is important in the Finnish mix, reaching 20% of production, utilizing locally plentiful wood resources
MUltifunctionality as a concept provides a way of incorporating community values into productive action, keeping culture alive umw
MUltifunctionality has been strongly tied to sustainability in a rural context, tied to pluriactivity and non-ag production and development-focused
Work interviewed 15 male heat entrepreneurs (no women present in study area) to understand the broad 'picture' associated with the idea
Heat entrepreneurs are typically agriculturalists, but pursue heat entrepreneurship in the off-season to supplement income
Heat plants range in size from 80 kw to 2 mw, range in utilization from a school to a full village heating plant
Different levels of investment observed, and different levels of participation levels (labor contribution) even in cooperatives
Typical process is taking wood from an owned forest and chipping to provide fuel for the heating systems
Participants split between 'promoters' who don't rely on the income, networkers who partly do but value relationships, diversifiers who need the income
Different participant 'class' determines concerns as well, more financial committment is related to more concern about operations, profitability
Tradeoffs are essential to understand and level of multifunctionality is dependent on individual actors and their values, not just economic 


12. Kelly, Erin Clover, Bliss, John C. 2012. From Industrial Ownership to Multifunctional Landscapes: Tenure Change and Rural Restructuring in Central Oregon. Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal 25:11

Many companies have divested from their Oregon forest land in the past two decades, raising new ownership possibilities
This divestment has raised the possibility of communities taking control of lands, creating conservation ownerships or community forests
Oregon forest lands appear to have gone through a transition to productivism and now, it appears, to a multifunctional paradigm
The idea of the 'New West' ties recreation and amenities to natural landscapes, part of a rural development paradigm exhibited in many US West places
Community capacity is becoming an important concept for assessing change over time, particularly as ownership of forest lands is shifting
Oregon was home to industrial forestry through the 20th Century, known to be unsustainable by mid-century, ended with Northwest Forest Plan
In wake of the massive loss of timber revenues some communities, such as Bend, have thrived be embracing amenities and influx of wealth
Oregon House Bill 2729, from 2005, allows municipalities to purchase privately owned forests to become community forests, using bonds
But community capacity to engage in this effort, along with differing visions of what landscapes should look like, impact viability
Gilchrist Oregon was not able to successfully create a community forest, while Bend had the assets and drive to seek this opportunity
But Oregon Department of Forestry did end up purchasing Gilchrist site lands, so state level investment can happen
Unclear the level to which Gilchrist can utilize this forest given its location for amenities, Bend is better places 



13. Kohler, Florent, Thierry, Chloe, Marchand, Guillaume. 2014. Multifunctional Agriculture and Farmers' Attitudes: Two Case Studies in Rural France. Human Ecology 42: 929-949

Farmer attitudes towards nature matter in conservation, historically a privileged relationship with farmers effectively seen as landscape managers
Political pressures and development processes constrain farmer actions, changing climate sees them as responsible for environmental protection
History, social dynamics, both very important for understanding farmer attitudes, which affects environmental variables given their level of control
Ag land is still common in France, where half territory is ag, but land consolidation shifted character of terrain and habitats
Destruction of hedges has damaged habitat, particularly for animals that mitigate agricultural pests, and eutrophication has affected marine habitats
This work interviewed farmers and residents in two communities, seeking differences in perception of multifunctionality, general environment
Farmers were typically found to have a more utilitarian view of nature, and they believed they were better understanders of nature than 'experts'
Ag tendency is to eliminate untamed nature, put all land into some sort of productive use, while civilians preferred more hedges, trees
Farmers typically describe land under proper management as 'clean and tidy', although organic farmers are more tolerant of wilderness


14. Lovell, Sarah Taylor, and Johnston, Douglas M. Creating multifunctional landscapes: how can the field of ecology inform the design of the landscape? Frontiers in Ecology and Environment 7(4): 212-220

Landscape Ecology is an applied field that examines landscape structure over time, incorporates spatial metrics, and creates analytical impact models
Broad process: Site description & landscape context - characterize/analyze status quo - create plan - design site for eco. function - monitor functions
Multi-scale approach necessary that incorporates externalities as part of landscape characterization, create process models
Ecosystem approach to multifunctionality is about provision of multiple services in same area, environmental, social, economic
Heterogeneity, biodiversity, water quality/quantity, overall performance of landscape are vital in design
Effective landscape design makes the ecosystem function apparent to help educate broader public
Experiment with this process in Illinois highlighted issues, including lack of typical involvement of ecologists at early stage
Multi-scale, multi-temporal approach key, complexity must be accepted, more applied research with more support from science community key, interdiscipline


15. Marsden, Terry, and Sonnino, Roberta. 2008. Rural development and the regional state: Denying multifunctional agriculture in the UK. Journal of Rural Studies 24, 422-431

The idea of multifunctional agriculture has been appropriated by competing interests, and the idea is not uniformly understood
It is varyingly understood as a palliative to productvist price squeezes, a consumptive countryside needing regulation, or part of sustainable develop.
"multifunctionality is a pro-active development tool to promote more sustainable economies of scope and synergy"
3 conditions to be met - add income and employment (to ag), adds to new ag meeting social expectations, radically redefine rural resources beyond farming
In the UK policy has not fully embraced multifunctionality despite verbiage, has rather promoted regionalization of existing trends, plus diversification
UK policy has mostly utilized pluriactive definition, pushing for multiple income streams on farms, while otherwise staying neoliberal
Rural areas in UK have long been tourist-dependent, as shown by issues post Foot/Mouth outbreak, which led to decreased revenues for farms
Local food, local markets/supply chains, coupled with visually attractive countryside are parts of a more multifunctional approach
UK Ag is stuck in contradiction, with broader system still rationalist, but coupled with local diversification - movement towards multifunctionality

 
16. McCarthy, James. 2005. Rural geography: multifunctional rural geographies \96 reactionary or radical? Progress in Human Geography 29:6, 773\96782

In the early 21st Century, for the first time in history the proportion of people living in urban areas exceeded that of those in rural areas
Rural Geo. studies have effectively embraced an academic labor division, focusing on rural North, with development studies focusing on rural South
Defines rural multifunctionality as managing landscapes to "produce a range of commodity and noncommodity use values simultaneously"
Multifunctionality grew out of concerns that P/P-P dichotomy was not helpful, empirically weak, recognizing multiple pathways/configurations
In the US, multifunctionality is often considered under the label 'working landscapes', in the sense of 'working forests' and the like
There are splits in understanding between the European tradition/definition and American tradition/definition, and in policy efforts
There is a need in multifunctionality debates for precise metrics, given the strong claims made by proponents
A tendency to accept uncritically that people increasingly demand environmental protections, amenities, is problematic, and to what degree they do
Multifunctionality has been used in a variety of ways, so its actual meaning gives rise to its potentially becoming part of neoliberalization
There is a danger that the ecosystem services narratives and the like could reduce all environmental benefits to multifunctionality to mere prices
Governance shiftsto put responsibilities on local entities could end up forcing burdens onto local producers, exacerbating inequality
Need for data on people's preferences on land use, on ecological consequences of shifting use, of better understanding 'rationality' in actor behavior

17. McCarthy, James. 2006. Rural geography: alternative rural economies \96 the search for alterity in forests, fisheries, food, and fair trade. Progress in Human Geography 30:6, 803-811

A number of efforts have been made to identify and understand rural economies on an alternative basis, emphasizing local production/consumption
'Alterity' encompasses not just food networks, but forest certification, community forests, fisheries, and the like
Gibson-Graham in 1996 called for recognizing and enacting alternatives to capitalist systems, both functions being equally important
The 'rural' is a common site for considering alterity, given proximity to production embeddedness of economic concerns in the idea of local
Community forests have existed in industrialized contexts as affront to capitalism as well as sites for multifunctionality debates
There are dangers to community forests in the form of elite capture, democratization may not be as strongly tied as desired
Similarly, certification schemes have suffered from barriers to entry to small producers, have not always had desired results
Fisheries have dealt with some of the same issues as forests, particularly with respect to certification issues
Food networks have similarly experienced problems getting established, with certification schemes not perfoming as predicted, becoming more capitalist
Embracing the idea of 'alternative' means specifying alternative to what, and what makes them alternative in nature
Production/exchange are still vital in most 'alternative' products, they do not entirely eschew capitalist dynamics
The 'Alternative' and 'Conventional' options may represent an unsustainable duality, with some things not being purely either
Alternative systems have not really changed much so far, and it remains to be seen how much they simply follow previous patterns


18. Mather, Alexander S., Hill, Gary, Nijnik, Maria. 2006. Post-productivism and rural land use: cul de sac or challenge for theorization? Journal of Rural Studies 22: 441-455

P-P has come under attack, but may benefit from a more focused definition in order to avoid some of the challenges
P-P has not seen its full potential realized, and may be particularly important when it comes to theorizing land use change
P-P has been weakened by W.Europe focus, fuzzy definitions, lack of empirics, and an over-focus on agriculture
Elements of P-P vary between authors, multiple dimensions exist, magnitudes required for transition to be P-P unclear, independence of trends/drivers
Under more restricted definitions, there does appear to be empirical evidence backing P-P idea, particlarly when looking at non-ag sectors in UK
Expansion of farms with forests is an example of post-productive shift, along with shift to de-intensified agriculture
Theorization remains difficult due to fuzziness of causation, Maslow's hierarchy may provide explanatory value for changing values in society
Spatial explanations may also be difficult to incorporate into theory, even as spatially distinct patterns appear to be important

Entrepreneurial skills of farmers, compared between Tuscany and Wales, may potentially have strong impact on multifunctionality
Tuscan way of doing agriculture combines it with rural development, but Wales does not appear to exhibit as integrated an approach
Different farmers have different orientations, different strategies, and different levels of entrepreneurial capability
Tuscan model demonstrates a situation where farmers have deep relationships with one another, shared understandings, and common institutions
Welsh model appears more recent, a result of pressures of the market and search for ways to cope


20. Naveh, Zev. 2001. Ten major premises for a holistic conception of multifunctional landscapes. Landscape and Urban Planning 57: 569-284

To fully understand the potential for a transdisciplinary approach to multifunctional landscapes one must abandon reductionist, positivist assumptions
Holism is necessary, along with a systems view, allowing subject experts to understand their own area and then explore other areas
10 Premises are presented to help determine "a holistic theory of landscapes...rooted in general systems theory"
MFLs exist as part of self-organizing, dissipative structures that do not reach equilibrium
They are more than the sum of parts, they are part off a hierarchical nature organization (holarchy), they are complex interactions of nature and culture
Concrete 'gestalt systems' of entire human ecosystem, transdisciplinary view could merge cultural diversity, ecological heterogeneity
Holistic insights are critical, surmounting dualism important and done by recognizing cognitive and natural basis
Transdisciplinary teams are essential, and "post-industrial symbiosis between nature and human society" essential to overcoming antagonism
* I am NOT doing this piece justice, but a full treatment requires incorporating systems theory more directly, not possible in this context


21. Potter, Clive, and Burney, Jonathan. 2002. Agricultural multifunctionality in the WTO - legitimate non-trade concern or disguised protectionism? Journal of Rural Studies 18, 35-47

The EU used claims of multifunctional benefits of agriculture to back up its position on continuing to provide subsidies to agricultural producers
This argument depends on actual production of these amenity, cultural, so on, benefits, and that continuing use of marginal land necessary for them
Counter-argument in trade talks is that multifunctionality is just a way of ensuring continued anti-competitive subsidies for political gain
Use of the term is particularly linked to countries in Europe with particularly strong ag traditions not fully liberalised
US has tended to remain somewhat neutral on term in negotiations, with developing countries attacking the multifunctional characterization
As a functional policy mechanism there is doubt about its true suitability and utility in providing the benefits claimed
The debate is partly about decoupling agricultural occupance from market concerns, but in liberal terms actual values hard to establish

A review of conceptual approaches and prospects for an integrative transitional framework. Journal of Environmental Management 90, S112-S123

Internal meaning/uses of 'multifunctionality' differ, but broad meaning is that productivity can be paired with other uses, like conservation, rural dev.
Multifunctional agriculture is only useful if it is connected to sustainability in development, primarily with respect to rural areas
There are a variety of different approaches, broadly grouped under market, land-use, actor-oriented, and public regulation
It is important to begin developing more coherent views of multifunctionality that cross these approaches, merging them
*Lots more here, but mostly tied to different approaches

Multifunctional landscapes and conservation efforts may be converging, ecosystem service provision being valued can tie two together
Marxan analysis attempts to efficiently allocate 'planning units' by comparing conservation cost to biodiversity, in defined grid
This study worked in South Africa (Little Karoo) to assess different land uses for each planning unit to assess potential conservation outcomes
Different types of land use are differentially useful in preserving biodiversity, and opportunity costs vary depending on planning unit
Cost-benefit analysis at heart of this work, essential but research intensive, beset by uncertainty on both cost and benefit sides
However, using this as a study area, material benefits of multifunctionality are present and demonstrated, cost reductions and income boosts
This depends on payment for ecosystem services, pollution regulation, and having tourism, to offset farmer opportunity costs

It is important to assess multifunctionality using an indicator to assess dynamism, drivers, inform management action
Study in Basque country incorporated indicators into broader index MESLI, including provisioning, regulation, cultural ecosystem services, biodiversity
Standardized index can compare locales side by side according to common scheme, and incorporate both socioeconomic and environmental factors
Statistical analysis of indicators in areas demonstrated different land uses/intensities differentially affected ecosystem service provision
Urban areas, monoculture agricultural landscapes were poorly multifunctional, low ecosystem service provision, forests tended to have higherES provision



25. Slee, Bill. 2007. Social indicators of multifunctional rural land use: The case of forestry in the UK. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 120: 31-40


Markets have been involved in the slow but sure degradation in economic significance of rural areas based in primary production
Mono-functional systems were a result of marketization, but have started to be challenged in the EU, with emphasis shifting to multifunctinality
General social aspects of forestry are subject of increased attention, but a challenge is to find indicators sufficient to inform debate/science
Conventional economics and its broadly utilitarian approach misses important dynamics, fails to recognize social values, including spiritual values
Multifunctional forestry has appeared in the UK due to changing social values, renewed attention to people and health of ecosystems
People clearly value forests and what they provide, they are a recreational and cultural resource, so non-market benefits exist
Traditional cost-benefit analysis insufficient to fully capture social indicators, broadened spectrum necessary



26. Soini, Katriina. 2001. Exploring human dimensions of multifunctional landscapes through mapping and map-making. Landscape and Urban Planning 57: 225-239


Maps serve as abstractions of reality, preceded by cognitive processes and creativity, connecting the person to the environment
Mental maps allow people to draw their impression of the environment, while concept mapping is more about connecting non-physical ideas
The idea of landscape is more complicated than it appears, incorporating compelx interacting processes and human perception thereof
Multifunctionality is a difficult concept, can be tied to mental, social process as well as material, focus on interactions
Mapping may function as a bridge between social and natural sciences, supporting landscape planning, letting people direct meaning of physical data
It can help identify what people perceive, what are boundaries, what are landmarks, and help in planning efforts
Mental maps can elucidate subjective world of sensory impressions, help identify collective subjective meanings, be combined with interviews, observation
*Good stuff here about cultural geo, mental impression of landscapes, to come back to it for method development!

Bioenergy can tie into multifunctionality by providing a revenue generating land use that also reduces nutrient loads emanating from agricultural land
A study in Illinois planted switchgrass and willow in lines in a cornfield, intercepting mobile nitrogen entering soil from fertilizer application
These crops absorbed nitrogen, and were valuable to farmers in that they could be sent to biofuel plants, offsetting total yield losses
Spatial heterogeneity in crop yields within the farm allowed biofuel crops to be planted in areas of lower corn yields, minimizing opportunity costs
Corn yields declined from 10.4 to 9.7/8.7 (mg/ha)/year (switchgrass/willow), but N03 leach went from 31.9 to 12.5/11.6 KgN/ha/yr, N20 Flux 2.2 to 1.9/2.0
For broader assessment, NDVI can be utilized to assess yields, allowing site selection for biofuel species planted in lines to intercept N

Idea of the multifunctional landscape is tied inexorably to multiple needs being satisfied by landscape, tied to sustainability
Understanding multifunctionality tied to assessing how land use and landscape functions interact to affect sustainability, mesh with multiple uses
Determining indicators is a difficult business, requiring understanding pragmatic issues as well as theory, and are aggregates of fundamental metrics
* Despite title, majority of this article is just neoclassical econ applied to multifunctionality

The typical state of European agricultural systemshas typically been one of multifunctionality, Spain and Portugal have continued tradition
Bird species have typically been on the decline in much of rural England, something of concern to the large birdwatching/hunting population in England
Game shooting is a potential multifunctionality avenue, given the significant expenditures of UK citizens on shooting ventures
A management system for pheasants is demonstrated to exhibit positive impacts on broader habitat and biodiversity metrics for birds, esp. population
Hedge management is particularly important for a variety of bird species, including pheasants, helping improve bird habitat

Post-Productivism  emerged in observation that ag lands were increasingly producing non-specifically agricultural crops/values to society
Concepts of Productivism and P-P emerged broadly from a political economy/structuralist context, emphasizing issues in agriculture
However, it may be better to view these as existing on a spectrum rather than as distinct entities due to longstanding non-ag product production on agland
In UK, productivism is typically associated with monocropped industrial ag production to meet national/international market demand for food
Tied to agricultural hegemony, intensive use of land, specialization, commercialization, in context of plentiful government subsidies
P-P tied more to changed perceptions of Ag, New forms of rural land use/production, environmental considerations, sustainability focus
P and P-P typically considered to be in opposition, mutually exclusive, with natural trend over time is shift from P to P-P
Political-Economic focus in both discourses ties analysis to role of state, markets, role of producers in capitalism, de-personalization of farmers
Discourse would be improved via utilizing an actor focus with strong considerations for actor behavior, beliefs, and values
Assessment of farmers according to this seems to indicate many in purported P-P mode still see selves in P way, strategic in their choices
P/P-P heavily tied to UK context, translating outside this can be difficult, and regional differences in ag practices exist even in Europe
Suggests using the term 'Multifunctional Agricultural Regime' to recognize position of individual farmers on spectrum between P and P/P
This would accord with farmers choosing to be P in some areas and P-P in others, not necessarily mutually exclusive paths
Also necessary to take Multifunctional concept beyond just agriculture, speak of 'Multifunctional Rural Regimes'

Even if an 'ideal' strong multifunctional system could be identified, variations from this would be expected due to differing circumstances
Multifunctionality is tied ultimately to farm-level actions and ideas, which are not conducive to homo economicus rational assumptions
Decision making can be considered on a graph with axis of weak to strong vs. enabling factors - wide to narrow. This forms a 'funnel'
Where a particular land user falls is tied to characterisstics such as profitability, land type, access to markets, country development
In much of the world, lowland farms tend to be less multifunctional than upland farms, but the spectrum is wide
Pure farms whether focus is on plants or animals, tend to be poorly multifunctional, but some mixed farms exist and are moreso
Hobby farms are often very multifunctional, in part due to their lack of need to focus on profitability, but may remain only moderately multifunctional
Mountainous areas are often seen to be more strongly multifunctonal, though cultural factors play a strong role
Farm level transitions can be rocky, are strongly dependent on broader markets, consumer support, and factors like a farmer's health
Farmers must be considered as having a range of options, restricted by their own risk tolerance and external stimuli, determiningmultifunctionality
An individual farmer's willingness to transition to multifunctionality, and this may be tied to multifunctional potential
Physical factors impact whether or not an individual can embrace multifunctionality and to what degree
Further qualitiative, ethnographic methods are necessary in order to better understand landholder action

Geography is the ideal discipline from which study of spatial aspects of multifunctional agriculture can take place
Scalar hierarchy, per Smith, is dangerous due to social constructed nature, but sensible to recognize scalar hierarchy as key in rural geography
Multifunctionality is typically more indirectly expressed at higher scale levels, and more direct at lower levels
Spatiality and its effects on multifunctionality are inadequately theorized at this point
Interactions between places and scales also insufficiently understood, and the dependencies which may occur between places


33. Wilson, Geoff A. 2010. Multifunctional 'quality' and rural community resilience. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers. 35:364-381

Multifunctionality has been applied to agricultural and later generally rural areas, recognizing commodity and non-commodity goods simultaneously made
It is more and more standard in both the north and south, raising questions of degrees of multifunctionality and pathways towards it
Applying multifunctionality to communities useful but must recognize the power and divergent community values present even where it is present
Quality can be a dangerous term to use, particularly in recognition of varying perceptions, most uses of term are normative, not purely ontological
Typically 'strong' multifunctionality is viewed as positive, 'weak' as negative, but this is not essentially the case given existing literature
Adding a useful normative element requires addressing emerging literature in resilience and vulnerability tied to human systems
Multifunctionality has often been tied to different capitals, environmental, social, umw, which invariably ties into existing systems of power
Communities that wish to be sustainable and resilient must embrace multifunctionality in order to survive
The relationship to multifunctionality with respect to integration into capitalist world market uncertain, can be opportunity for community or threat
Most communities will be somewhere between extremes of monofunctionality and perfect multifunctionality, with monofunctional places typically weaker
Rural systems can be seen evolving over time, with a 'decision-making corridor' widening over time, even as move to productivism reduces multifunction.
They have shifted from subsistence ag, to embeddedness in market systems and productivism, to current state of open decision paths to future
Policy can be constructed and employed to boost multifunctionality, tied to cultural memory and improving local capital, as part of moral goal
It may be possible to prevent currently multifunctional places from succumbing to productivism, to mitigage 'super-productivism'
'Scenically attactive' rural areas have an advantage, and it is important to reconsider food systems, and help individuals shift personal goals/values

The multifunctional ag idea existed in EU documents by the 1980s, tied to farm subsidies many EU countries sought to protect
Strongly multifunctional situations have high capital, low intensity farming, and be sustainable, avoid long supply chains, local/regional embedding
It is a normative concept with strong flavor being considered good, and survival of farming tied to adopting strong pathway
Territorial expression is critical for understanding multifunctionality, with direct impacts observed/measured at farm level
Spatiality is vital to understand multifunctionality, and even though it is flawed, nested hierarchy of spatial levels is useful
Less direct multifunctional impacts observed as one moves up the hierarchy of levels, with national/global multifunctionality being very much indirect
Farm level is the smallest, most important level, allowing for site diversity within farm, emphasizing owner/operator decisions/values in totality
Rural community level is a vital level to consider due to economies of scale and interdependencies between local land owners, may be essential dimension
Holism and sustainability are best served at community level where individuals affect their community, and at this level production ties to consumption
Regional multifunctionality is key due to tendencies for rural policy to take place at this level, policy mediated at this level
National level multifunctionality consideratons are important as states set the stage for lower level policy institutions, ideology key here
The type of multifunctionality considered is mediated by the relevant scale, so farm multifunctionality key at farm level, rural multifunct. at community
Assessing multifunctionality at global level generally absent, farms impacted by globalisation, it is tied to less multifunctionality
There is no global enforcement similar to nation-state level enforcement, and multifunctionality may be zero-sum between nations



35. Wilson, Geoff A. & Burton, Rob J.F. 2015. 'Neo-productivist' agriculture: spatial-temporal versus structuralist perspectives. Journal of Rural Studies 38, 52-64

The idea of 'neo-productivist' agriculture has arisen as a result of debates about the apparent transition from productivism to post-productivism
As opposed to going P-P, many farms are observed engaging in further intensification, in part in response to market demands
An AOST perspective (Agency-oriented spatio-temporal) is seen as superior to a structuralist perspective due to flexibility, agent focus
Arguably, the debate now takes place in a different world than of 20 years ago, now that malthusian arguments are being resurrected, population boom here
AOST approach argues that pathways which could lead to multifunctionality exist between productivist and p-p poles, and transition seen in history
Productivist tendencies have potentially existed for a long time, but history has determined the extent to which they were intensified/extensified
Path dependency is a factor to consider, and the actions of actors in a particular context, which may push pathways in a certain direction
Neo-productivist areas often saw a move away from productivism, but then a return to it rather than a p-p adoption or multifunctionality
Structural views see neo-productivism as evolving over time in response to market pressures, taking cooperative or competitive forms
So the key difference between AOST and structural approaches are the level of agency accorded to individual actors and their value systems
AOST also tends to see neo-productivism as a new trend in productivism, not just an evolution, and tied to shift in exposure to markets
Differences also in multifunctionality link - dependent/nonexistent in structural approach, vs. loss of multifunctionality in AOST approach
