Chapter 1 - Sven Stremke and Andy van den Dobbelsteen

energy landscapes: "physical environments that provide energy for human use"
not mono-functional, and transition is inevitable with or without active participation by planners/designers
sustainable energy landscapes "can evolve on the basis of locally available renewable energy sources without compromising landscape quality"
 - quality here represents all the other provisions the landscape provides


Reading The Changing Energy Landscape - Martin J. Pasqualetti

4 broad historic phases of energy economy - organic, mineral, electric, sustainable
Landscapes have been modified by need for energy in each phase - deforestation, landscape scars, nuclear accidents, all affect landscapes
Sustainable landscapes increasingly incorporate renewables, which have their deleterious impacts, typicall local, but cause conflict


Strong Feelings: Emotional Landscape of Wind Turbines - Dirk Sijmons and Machiel van Dorst

Energy decentralization accompanies move to sustainability, but changing land use can provoke social conflict, viewshed 'pollution'


Energy Potential Mapping and Heat Mapping: Prerequisite for Energy-Conscious Planning and Design - Andy van den Dobbelsteen, Siebe Broersma, Michiel Fremouw

EPM involves mapping potential energy flows associated with a location, sinks and sources can be mapped
Inherently systems-focused, tied to the desire to more efficiently use energy, can involve heat mapping of sinks and sources
EPMs can be 'stacked' to create a 3D model of total energy potentials as they vary across the landscape
Method limited by data availability, quality - but can become basis for scenario planning, real-time updates


Five Step Approach to the Design of SELs - Sven Stremke

Differerent planning approaches have been employed over the years, a 5-step process is proposed for SEL design
Scenario development is important, allows for exploration of pathways, incorporation of social information


Multicriteria Decision Analysis for the Planning and Design of Sustainable Energy Landscapes - Adrienne Gret-Regamey and Ulrike Wissen Hayek

Framework for assessing land impacts and optimization: Renewable Energy Tech. potential mapping, Ecosys. maping, MCDA, Optimization, Engage
Multiple potential landscape designs may be optimal or desired, facilitating assessment and decision making helped by MCDA
Map out relevant potentials, map out other important factors like services with weightings
Technical and Economic factors can define suitability for use, exclusion criteria then used to keep sensitive areas unused
Further inclusion of exclusion factors can be achieved, including cognitive, social factors
Engagement can involve visualization of data and presentation to stakeholders to begin an actual planning process with community engagement


Integrated Optimization of Spatial Structures and Energy Systems - Gernot Stoeglehner and Michael Narodoslawsky

Both supply and demand aspects of energy systems can be effectively modeled to produce optimization scenarios
Such optimization can be done with different assumptions, parameters, and designs can be scaled/contextualized as necessary



***Broader stuff

Similar methods have been applied for islands, northern europe, canada
The social cannot be ignored, sustainability means you are going to have to address what people want before implementation
